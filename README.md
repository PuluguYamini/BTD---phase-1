# Brain--Tumor--Detection using Matlab

Medical image processing is the most challenging and emerging field now a days. Processing of MRI images is one of the parts of this field. This project makes MRI image analysis accessible to more people who need not have to be specialist on MRI imaging. 

MRI imaging is less harmful than X-ray. It is less attenuated by bones. This project can make MRI image processing and tumor detection process faster and cheaper.

Phase 1 involves all the image processing steps for the given MRI image and detects if there is a tumor in a given MRI image or not. If there is a tumor then it needs to specify the location of the tumor. This phase is implemented by a simple program using the Anisotropic diffusion filter.

The Architecture of the phase1 involves:

Anisotropic filtering: It is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces of computer graphics that are at oblique viewing angles with respect to the camera where the projection of the texture (not the polygon or other primitive on which it is rendered) appears to be non-orthogonal

Morphological image processing: is a collection of non-linear operations related to the shape or morphology of features in an image. 

Image segmentation: is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.
